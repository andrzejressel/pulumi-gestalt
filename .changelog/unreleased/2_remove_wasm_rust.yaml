title: Remove Rust abstraction over Wasm
description: |
  This change simplifies code and documentation by removing the Rust abstraction layer over Wasm. It had no advantages for users and introduced unnecessary complexity. Wasm joins C FFI as integration only feature that users does not need to interact with directly.
