///
/// ## Import
///
/// Automation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
///
/// * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deliveryPipelines/{{delivery_pipeline}}/automations/{{name}}`
///
/// * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{delivery_pipeline}}/{{name}}`
///
/// * `{{location}}/{{delivery_pipeline}}/{{name}}`
///
/// When using the `pulumi import` command, Automation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/automation:Automation default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deliveryPipelines/{{delivery_pipeline}}/automations/{{name}}
/// ```
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/automation:Automation default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{delivery_pipeline}}/{{name}}
/// ```
///
/// ```sh
/// $ pulumi import gcp:clouddeploy/automation:Automation default {{location}}/{{delivery_pipeline}}/{{name}}
/// ```
