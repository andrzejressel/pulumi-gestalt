/// Provides a resource to create an organization.
///
/// !> **WARNING:** When migrating from a `feature_set` of `CONSOLIDATED_BILLING` to `ALL`, the Organization account owner will received an email stating the following: "You started the process to enable all features for your AWS organization. As part of that process, all member accounts that joined your organization by invitation must approve the change. You donâ€™t need approval from member accounts that you directly created from within your AWS organization." After all member accounts have accepted the invitation, the Organization account owner must then finalize the changes via the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/home#/organization/settings/migration-progress). Until these steps are performed, the provider will perpetually show a difference, and the `DescribeOrganization` API will continue to show the `FeatureSet` as `CONSOLIDATED_BILLING`. See the [AWS Organizations documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html) for more information.
///
/// !> **WARNING:** [Warning from the AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_EnableAWSServiceAccess.html): "We recommend that you enable integration between AWS Organizations and the specified AWS service by using the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. Doing so ensures that the service is aware that it can create the resources that are required for the integration. How the service creates those resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other AWS service."

/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```ignore
/// use pulumi_wasm_rust::Output;
/// use pulumi_wasm_rust::{add_export, pulumi_main};
/// #[pulumi_main]
/// fn test_main() -> Result<(), Error> {
///     let org = organization::create(
